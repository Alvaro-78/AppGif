# Getting Started with Create React App

## I made this project to practice with third party API from [Giphy for development](https://developers.giphy.com/)

### Using custome Hooks and testing components

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
I use Enzyme for test the components
